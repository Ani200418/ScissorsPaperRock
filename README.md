# ScissorsPaperRock
The Rock Paper Scissors game is a classic hand game where two players (in this case, you vs the computer) each choose one of the three options — Rock 🪨, Paper 📄, or Scissors ✂️. The outcome is determined by a simple set of rules:

Rock beats Scissors

Scissors beats Paper

Paper beats Rock

If both players choose the same, it’s a draw.
